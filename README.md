Hello everyone, my name is Sseggujja John Leonard and I am God's technologist.
That simply means that I was created to glorify God through technology and hence there I do Holy Spirit inspired innovations.
I am also going to be solving all your technology related innovations, and all this will be done in the mighty name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the Living God.Amen.
